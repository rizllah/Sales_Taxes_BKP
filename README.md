# Sales_Taxes

Item:
An Item object is created as a base class with properties which will be inherited.

Stock:
A Stock object is created in which a list of Items are stored as the store’s inventory. In the Stock class, there is a PrintStock method which displays the list of items in stock to the user. 

Get Shopping List:
The user is prompted to select an item from the stock list repeatedly until ‘0’ is entered  to stop adding items. At this point the loop is terminated. Each entry is validated and the user is prompted to try again with a correct entry if incorrect. All correct user entries are saved as a list.

Cart:
The list is sent to the CreateCart method in the Cart class where each item is used to create a derived Sale_Item object. A Sale_Item has a user specified quantity. The quantity property of a Sale_Item together with its Item inherited type, price and imported properties are used to calculate its sale price. Totals and SalesTax property of the Cart are calculated  using methods in the class.

Receipt:
The Print_Receipt method loops through all Sale_Items in the Cart parameter and writes relevant information about the entire sale to the console as a receipt for the user.
